In this blog we are going to see what is Kubernetes and about kubernetes cluster.

## **What is Kubernetes ?**

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*H2FyGDpOR_mbQ5N2.jpg align="center")

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The open source project is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). So kubernetes is a tool that can manage the containers and monitor the container if any container goes down then kubernetes automatically launches it again in a sec without any Human Intervention. They use the concept of Replicas Controller to automatically launch the pod. So there are many resources in Kubernetes which have their own role. Some resources are RC, RS , POD,SERVICE, SECRET, PVC,DEPLOYMENT ETC.

## **Kubernetes Cluster**

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines for running containerized applications. If you’re running Kubernetes, you’re running a cluster. At a minimum, a cluster contains a control plane and one or more compute machines, or nodes. As we know kubernetes run in a cluster there are two types of clusters that are SINGLE-NODE OR MULTI-NODE CLUSTER.

For Refernce you can use below link for launching AWS EC2-Instance by using ansible

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nehal-ingole\_arth-vimaldaga-righteducation-activity-6787632452111237120-fCGO](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nehal-ingole_arth-vimaldaga-righteducation-activity-6787632452111237120-fCGO)

Let see how we actually create a kubernetes cluster using ansible

---

## **Prerequisites for Multi-Node Cluster**

### **Hardware Requirements**

One or more machines running one of:

* Ubuntu 16.04+
    
* Debian 9
    
* CentOS 7
    
* RHEL 7
    
* Fedora 25/26 (best-effort)
    
* HypriotOS v1.0.1+
    
* Cloud Computing
    

Minimal required memory & CPU (cores)

* Master node’s minimal required memory is 2GB and the worker node needs minimum is 1GB
    
* The master node needs at least 1.5 and the worker node needs at least 0.7 cores.

## **Cluster setup**

For Installing Setup we have to do some Environment ready for the cluster.

So First of all it requires us to do the setup. In my case I useAWS .So First we have to make Instances with 1GB RAM **(Note Cluster setup requires minimum 2GB RAM. In this part we are going to see how to ignore this requirement).**.

### ***Master node configuration***

I am going to use linux ami2 , AWS not have any repository for downloading the kubernetes and other resources . For that we need to create one repo for kubernetes . so Playbook for master node :-

### Adding Kubeadm repositories On Master node

Docker is **an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications**. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*kTu_UCYQMWubk8eeo-HUvg.jpeg align="left")

**Now** for running the service we need separate containers, either we can download it one by one manually or we can directly use the below command to pull all the necessary images from the ***docker hub.***

```powershell
kubeadm config images pull
```

One of the requirements is to set up the driver to systemd (by default driver is cgroup, you can check it using docker info command), by using the below command to do the same.

Open the file and paste the below paste :- vim /etc/docker/daemon.json

> *{*
> 
> *“exec-opts”: \[“native.cgroupdriver=systemd”\]*
> 
> *}*

After making changes, restart the docker service

```powershell
systemctl restart docker
```

One more requirement for networking is to have iproute-tc software, download it using yum command.

```powershell
yum install iproute-tc -y
```

Now we also need to specify the range of IP address we want to assign to the pods or containers, also because we are doing the setup on top AWS, we might not have enough RAM or CPU in the system so we can ignore these warnings/errors using “ — ignore-preflight-errors” keyword.

```powershell
Kubeadm init — pod-network-cidr=10.240.0.0/16 -ignore-preflight-errors=NumCPU — ignore-preflight-errors=Mem
```

Now the system is configured as a master.

Normally we have a separate client who will use the kubectl command on the master, but just for testing, we can make the master as the client/user. Now if you run the “kubectl” command, it will fail (we already have kubectl software in the system). It will fail because client should always know where master is running (the IP of the master), so client should know the port number of API, and username and password of master, so to use this cluster as a normal user, you can copy below files in the HOME location, the files contain all the credentials of master node.

```powershell
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Now the system is also configured as a client.

To configure some extra networks, just run the below commands for flannel configuration.

```powershell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

To generate a token so that worker nodes can join:

```powershell
kubeadm token create — print-join-command
```

lets see above all this command in this ansible playbook how it looks

## Playbook for config Masternode

### **Worker node configuration**

**There is not such different for creating worker nodes with respective to the Master nodes we have to use same**

In worker nodes also, we need to do the same setup as the master node except for a few commands like pulling docker images because it’s not required in the worker node.

> ***sudo su — root***
> 
> ***yum install docker -y***
> 
> ***systemctl enable docker — now***
> 
> ***vi /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo***
> 
> *\[kubernetes\]*
> 
> *name=Kubernetes*
> 
> *baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-$basearch*
> 
> *enabled=1*
>

> 
> *exclude=kubelet kubeadm kubectl*
> 
> ***yum install kubeadm — disableexcludes=Kubernetes***
> 
> ***systemctl enable kubelet — now***
> 
> ***vim /etc/docker/daemon.json***
> 
> *{*
> 
> *“exec-opts”: \[“native.cgroupdriver=systemd”\]*
> 
> *}*
> 
> ***systemctl restart docker***
> 
> ***yum install iproute-tc -y***
> 
> ***cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf***
> 
> *net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1*
> 
> *net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1*
> 
> *EOF*
> 
> ***sudo sysctl — system***

## Lets see in playbook Slave node

Run ansible\_playbook for setup the kubernetes cluster

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aJvl1RhmNuhIrGLWQYjsKQ.png align="left")

after succesfully running the playbook sucesfully you can see the instances launch sucesfully

we can see the wordpress page

You can see the Kubernetes launch successfully and Wordpress

You can see this all the code in my GITHUB

Due to some reason i am not able to push my code on Github that why i created all the file manually

## Conclusion

Kubernetes emerges as a powerful tool for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes utilizes a cluster architecture consisting of a control plane and one or more compute nodes. The cluster can be configured as a single-node or multi-node setup, offering flexibility to accommodate diverse workload requirements.

Key to Kubernetes' functionality is its ability to monitor containers and automatically restart them if they fail, ensuring high availability without human intervention. This is achieved through components like the Replicas Controller, which orchestrates the automatic launch of pods when needed.

Within the Kubernetes ecosystem, various resources play distinct roles in managing applications, including Replication Controllers (RC), ReplicaSets (RS), Pods, Services, Secrets, Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), Deployments, and more. Each resource contributes to the overall efficiency and resilience of the containerized environment.

Ultimately, Kubernetes empowers organizations to streamline their container workflows, optimize resource utilization, and deliver robust, scalable applications with ease. Whether it's a single-node setup for smaller projects or a multi-node cluster for enterprise-grade deployments, Kubernetes provides the foundation for modern, cloud-native application development.

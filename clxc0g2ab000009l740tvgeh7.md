---

### Start and Enable Docker

Start Docker and enable it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

---

### Verify Docker Installation

Run a test container to verify that Docker is installed correctly:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

---

## Step 2: Install Portainer CE

### Create a Volume for Portainer Data

Portainer stores its data in a Docker volume. Create this volume with the following command:

```bash
sudo docker volume create portainer_data
```

### Run Portainer Container

Pull the Portainer image from Docker Hub and run it:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

* The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode.
    
* The `-p` flags map the container ports to the host ports.
    
* The `--restart=always` flag ensures Portainer restarts automatically if it crashes.
    
* The `-v` flags mount volumes for persistent data storage.

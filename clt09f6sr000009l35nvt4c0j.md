## **Explanation**

* **argocd login:** This command is used to authenticate with an ArgoCD server. You need to provide the URL of the ArgoCD server you want to connect to.
    
* **argocd app create:** Creates a new application within ArgoCD. This command allows you to specify the name of the application you want to create.
    
* **argocd app delete:** Deletes an existing application from ArgoCD. You need to provide the name of the application you want to delete.
    
* **argocd app get:** Retrieves detailed information about a specific application managed by ArgoCD. You need to provide the name of the application you want to get information about.
    
* **argocd app list:** Lists all applications managed by ArgoCD along with their current status.
    
* **argocd app sync:** Syncs the state of an application with the desired state defined in Git. This ensures that the application is up to date with the latest configuration.
    
* **argocd app rollouts:** Lists recent rollouts of an application, including information about the rollout status and any errors encountered.
    
* **argocd app rollback:** Rolls back an application to a previous version. You need to specify the name of the application you want to rollback.

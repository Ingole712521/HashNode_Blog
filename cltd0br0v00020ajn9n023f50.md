## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows you to build scalable and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a server in Node.js from scratch. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to set up a basic server, handle HTTP requests, and build RESTful APIs.

## Fs module

![node-http-server - Codesandbox](https://screenshots.codesandbox.io/fn42i/14.png align="left")

In Node.js, the `fs` (file system) module provides an API for interacting with the file system on your machine. It allows you to perform various file-related operations such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files and directories. In this blog, we'll explore the capabilities of the `fs` module and learn how to use it effectively in your Node.js applications.

Certainly! The provided code snippet utilizes the Node.js `fs` (file system) module and the `os` (operating system) module to perform file system operations and retrieve information about the system's CPUs, respectively. Let's break down the code and explain it in detail:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); // Importing the file system module
const os = require('os'); // Importing the operating system module
```

* `fs`: The `fs` module in Node.js allows you to perform file system operations such as reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories.
    
* `os`: The `os` module provides a way of interacting with the operating system. In this code, we're using it to retrieve information about the system's CPUs.
    

```javascript
console.log(os.cpus().length); // Print the number of CPU cores
```

* `os.cpus()`: This method returns an array containing information about each CPU core on the system. We use `.length` to determine the number of CPU cores available.
    

```javascript
fs.writeFileSync("./file.txt" , "Hello World"); // Blocking file write operation (Synchronous)
```

* `fs.writeFileSync()`: This method writes data to a file synchronously, meaning it blocks the execution of the script until the operation is complete. In this case, it writes the string "Hello World" to a file named `file.txt` in the current directory.
    

```javascript
fs.writeFile("./file.txt" , "Hello World" , (err) => {
  console.log();
}); // Non-blocking file write operation (Asynchronous)
```

* `fs.writeFile()`: This method writes data to a file asynchronously, meaning it does not block the execution of the script. It takes a callback function that is executed once the operation is complete or encounters an error. In this case, it also writes the string "Hello World" to the `file.txt` file, but asynchronously.

## Building a Basic HTTP Server

### Introduction

Node.js allows you to create powerful servers easily using its built-in HTTP module. In this blog, we'll explore how to build a basic HTTP server in Node.js using the `http` module. We'll also demonstrate how to handle HTTP requests and log them to a file using the `fs` module.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const http = require('http');

const myServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Server logic goes here
});

const PORT = 8000;
myServer.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`));
```

In this code, we create an HTTP server usin the `http.createServer()` method and specify a callback function to handle incoming requests.

### Handling HTTP Requests

Next, we'll define the logic to handle different HTTP requests based on the requested URL.

```javascript
const myServer = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const log = `${Date.now()}: ${req.url} - New request received\n`;
  fs.appendFile('log.txt', log, (err) => {
    if (err) console.error('Error logging request:', err);
  });

  switch (req.url) {
    case '/':
      res.end('Hello from the server');
      break;
    case '/about':
      res.end('I am Nehal Ingole');
      break;
    case '/contact-us':
      res.end('You can contact me');
      break;
    default:
      res.end('404 Not Found');
  }
});
```

This code appends a log entry to a file (`log.txt`) for each incoming request and handles different URLs with appropriate responses.

### Logging Requests to a File

We use the `fs.appendFile()` method to log each request to a file named `log.txt`. This helps in tracking and debugging incoming requests.

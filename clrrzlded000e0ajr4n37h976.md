# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and service offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, networking, databases, analytics, machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. Azure allows individuals and organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers.

# **What are availability zones?**

Many Azure regions provide *availability zones*, which are separated groups of datacenters within a region. Availability zones are close enough to have low-latency connections to other availability zones. They're connected by a high-performance network with a round-trip latency of less than 2ms. However, availability zones are far enough apart to reduce the likelihood that more than one will be affected by local outages or weather. Availability zones have independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. They're designed so that if one zone experiences an outage, then regional services, capacity, and high availability are supported by the remaining zones. They help your data stay synchronized and accessible when things go wrong.

Datacenter locations are selected by using rigorous vulnerability risk assessment criteria. This process identifies all significant datacenter-specific risks and considers shared risks between availability zones.

# **What is IaaS?**

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS is one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service ([SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas/)), platform as a service ([PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-paas/)), and [server less](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-serverless-computing/).

Migrating your organization's infrastructure to an IaaS solution helps you reduce maintenance of on-premises data centers, save money on hardware costs, and gain real-time business insights. IaaS solutions give you the flexibility to scale your IT resources up and down with demand. They also help you quickly provision new applications and increase the reliability of your underlying infrastructure.

IaaS lets you bypass the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only pay for a particular resource for as long as you need it. A [cloud computing service provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/azure-iaas/) manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—including operating systems, middleware, and applications.

# **What is PaaS?**

Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. You purchase the resources you need from a [cloud service provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.

Like [IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-iaas/), PaaS includes infrastructure—servers, storage, and networking—but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more. PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.

PaaS allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestrators such as [Kubernetes](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-kubernetes/), or the development tools and other resources. You manage the applications and services you develop, and the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.

# **What is SaaS?**

Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

SaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a [cloud service provider. You rent the use of](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) an app for your organization, and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app softwar[e, and app data are lo](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/)cated in the service provider’s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data as well. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with an app at minimal upfront cost.
